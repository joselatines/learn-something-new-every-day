### Architectural Models

Software architecture refers to the structure a software should have, the parts to build, and how to combine them to work efficiently.

It's worth noting that software architecture doesn't have a single definition; it can have different interpretations depending on each professional's perspective.

#### Types of Software Architectures

1. **Client-Server:**
   - Pattern where a server provides service to a client.
   - Pros: Centralized data, low maintenance, possible data recovery.
   - Cons: Vulnerable to viruses, trojans, phishing. Susceptible to DoS attacks, and data modification during transmission.

2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC):**
   - Allows separation of components based on their responsibilities.
   - Uses three components: model, view, and controller.
   - Rapid development, modifications don't affect the entire architecture.
   - Cons: Complex, requires well-trained developers.

3. **Microservices Architecture:**
   - Creates software components dedicated to specific tasks.
   - Self-sufficient components that evolve independently.
   - Pros: Encapsulated components, independent evolution, development with different technologies.
   - Cons: Requires a good team for management.

4. **Layered Architecture:**
   - Addresses issues of spaghetti architecture.
   - Layers with different purposes, such as data visualization and database access.
   - Facilitates task distribution.

5. **Hexagonal Architecture:**
   - Isolates inputs and outputs from the application's internal logic.
   - Generates independent parts that can be changed without affecting the rest.
